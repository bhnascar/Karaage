## Current supported functionality
1. Add cube
2. Select/Deselect cube
3. Select/Deselect multiple cubes
4. Delete cube
4. Rotate (Local X/Y/Z)
5. Translate (World X/Y/Z)

## Goals
1. Recreate minimal editor functionality (enough for simple level design)
2. Integrate 3DConnexion Space Navigator support to test level design workflow with said device
3. Integrate Novint Falcon support and test level design workflow with said device
