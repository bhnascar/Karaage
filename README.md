# Karaage
Prototype level editor built as a game level using Unreal Engine 4.

![alt tag](https://github.com/cs210/Karaage/blob/master/editor.png)

## Current supported functionality
1. Add cube
2. Select/Deselect cube
3. Select/Deselect multiple cubes
4. Delete cube
5. Display local orientation (axes) of cube
6. Rotate (Local X/Y/Z)
7. Translate (World X/Y/Z)
8. Scale (Local X/Y/Z)

Editor actions are currently triggered by keyboard shortcuts. We are looking into adding alternative input by having other input devices simply fire off the corresponding keyboard events. Eventually we will want more native integration, but this may be adequate for the purposes of prototyping.

## Goals
1. Recreate minimal editor functionality (enough for simple level design)
2. Integrate 3DConnexion Space Navigator support to test level design workflow with said device
3. Integrate Novint Falcon support and test level design workflow with said device
