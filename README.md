## Karaage Editor

### Current supported functionality
1. Add cube
  1. By player position
  2. By cursor position
  3. By trigger point
2. Select/Deselect cube
  1. By line trace from player viewpoint
  2. By line trace through cursor
  3. By cursor overlap
3. ~~Select/Deselect multiple cubes
4. Delete cube
5. Display local orientation (axes) of cube
6. Rotate (Local X/Y/Z) (via keyboard)
7. Translate (World X/Y/Z) (with Falcon)
8. Scale (Local X/Y/Z) (via keyboard)
9. Drop-to-ground
10. 3D cursor (Moves left/right/forward/backward/up/down)
11. Highlight when cursor overlaps object
12. Multiple types of objects (cube/sphere/cone/wedge/cylinder)
13. Snapping to nearest grid ticks in all axes
14. 3D mouse support (functional, but code needs refinement) (now with analog input!)
15. Novint Falcon support (functional, but code needs refinement)

### Goals
1. ~~Recreate minimal editor functionality (enough for simple level design)~~
2. ~~Integrate 3DConnexion Space Navigator support to test level design workflow with said device~~
3. ~~Integrate Novint Falcon support and test level design workflow~~
4. ~~Integrate mobile device object-manipulation support and test level design workflow~~
5. Create functional menu for editor settings
6. Export created levels to UE4
7. Haptic feedback for Novint Falcon. Ex: Magnetic lines to guide axis-specific edits, haptic walls to guide precise object placement.

## Karaage.io

This is the landing page for the Karaage level editor that also details editor progress over time. Note that `secrets.yml` is in the `.gitignore` - please generate your own secrets in order to run your own copy of the website.

### Setup

karaage.io is built on Ruby on Rails and developed with Ruby 2.1.0. Please check that your environment is setup as such, and run `bundle install` to make sure everything is up to date.

### Updating the site

Whenever you update or add CSS, JavaScript, or other media, be sure to run `rake assets:precompile` to make sure all assets are compressed for speed.
