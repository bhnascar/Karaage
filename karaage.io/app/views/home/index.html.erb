  <p class="lead">Game design traditionally are limited to the standard workstation and a 2D monitor. However, this makes development tedious when it involves virtual reality &mdash; putting on and taking off the headset multiple times over the span of an hour to check object placement wears on the user really quickly. Karaage aims to make greyboxing simple by allowing you to add and manipulate actors in a world while wearing the VR headset.</p>
